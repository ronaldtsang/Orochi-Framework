Try the demo:
--------------------------------------
### Full-Function Testing Tool ###

webapp link(open the above app first): http://orochis-den.com/orochi_jqmdemo/app.html
* To close the application: you must turn off the "Native Service" first, else the "Native Service" will keep running.

After you start the demo application(with "Native Service" on), your may open the "webapp link" on your mobile's browser


How to start?
--------------------------------------
1. Download all [javascript files](https://github.com/downloads/ronaldtsang/Orochi-Framework/orochi_1.0_js.zip)

2. It is recommended to study the [example webapp](https://github.com/ronaldtsang/Orochi-Framework/blob/master/web_example_with_source/app.html) first.

3. Include the following lines in you webapp:
`<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js"></script>`
`<script src="js/weboo/weboo.js"></script>`
`<script src="js/orochi/orochi.js"></script>`
`<script src="js/orochi/orochi.ext.js"></script>`

4. Setup your own [offline.manifest](https://github.com/ronaldtsang/Orochi-Framework/blob/master/web_example_with_source/offline.manifest) if you want to have an offline accessible webapp.

5. Download the [example source code](https://github.com/downloads/ronaldtsang/Orochi-Framework/orochi_1.0_android_orochi_example_5-29.zip) and modify it to suit your needs. (or you may test it with the "Full-Function Testing Tool" first)

Advance
--------------------------------------
### To build your own Native API: ###
1. Take a look at the native package [orochi.nativeadapter.RequestHandler](https://github.com/ronaldtsang/Orochi-Framework/tree/master/android/orochi_source/src/orochi/nativeadapter/requesthandler) 
2. Take a look at the [javascript files](https://github.com/ronaldtsang/Orochi-Framework/tree/master/web_example_with_source/source_js/orochi)(But not the "orochi.js")
3. I think you should be able to make it XD.
4. Please send it to me, if you think your API is useful to others.
